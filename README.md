# Intro

This project is indended to provide you with a rudimentary development environment for web projects. It will enable you to write certain kinds of software with only an iPad or iPhone _(Id prefer an iPad esspecialy with screensize and such..)_.

## Some assumptions about you:
- You like to do some rudimentary development On-The-Go or find the idea of development on an iPad has potential
- You write web based softwarte (With Python or PHP and JavaScript or TypeScript)
- You are really, really, really good in programming without a mouse (No mouse on iPad for now - lets see what iOS 13 brinds)

## Goals
### Goals of this project
- See if its viable to develop only with an iPad connected via SSH or Mosh to a remote server (hosting this Docker immage)
- Try to find a somewhat semi effective workflolw

### Non goals
- Provide anything more than rudimentary PHP
- Support of Python2.X (Its installed but only to install stuff that depends on it not for development)

# Install
